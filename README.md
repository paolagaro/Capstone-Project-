# Capstone-Project-
Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL / 2009-2010) This analysis examines FFEL student loan data for the 2009-2010 academic year. Using Python, I merged, cleaned, and prepared the data to answer key questions related to loan volume and distribution by type, institution, and state.
# 🧾 Data Analysis Project: Federal Student Loan Program (FFEL)

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of data from the **Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL)** program. By combining programming and business intelligence tools, I was able to extract, clean, analyze, and visualize insights that highlight key patterns in student loan disbursement across institutions and states.

## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned and standardized messy files and column names.
- Merged quarterly loan data into a consolidated dataset.
- Converted currency and numeric fields from text to numeric types.
- Replaced missing values and removed non-standard or duplicate entries.

### 2. 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identified top loan categories by volume and value.
- Analyzed request vs. disbursement ratios across time.
- Aggregated data by school, state, and institution type to identify regional trends.
- Computed correlations between loan requests and actual disbursements.
- Exported summaries and metrics for use in dashboards and reports.

### 3. 📈 Visualization & Presentation

- Built a Power BI dashboards for user-friendly exploration of findings.
- Created visualizations to highlight top-performing states and institutions.
- Compiled a 6-page report summarizing insights, trends.
